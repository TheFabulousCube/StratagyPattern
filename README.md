# StratagyPattern
This is an excercise using the Stratagy Pattern.  It's based on https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/ch01.html
  I like writting Java excecises in C#, I can't copy/paste and I have to think while I'm coding.
  
  Did you notice that since all ducks are derived form **Duck** class, I can create a **List\<Duck>** to hold *all* the ducks, then loop through them together?  I've done this somewhere else, probably a Factory pattern.
  I even added a **CustomDuck** class that can be decided at instantiation.
